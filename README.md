# Raspberry-pi-project-for-blinds
IEA Raspberry Pi Competition 2016
In this project we create two python files:
 camera.py: we used a camera and a push button; when the push button is clicked an image is captured and saved in the pi directory.
 wall.py: we used a sensor and an earphone; when the distance(taken by the ultrasonic sensor) is less than 15 a warning sound is played.
